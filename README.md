## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `config.py` to define your API replacements:

```python
DLL_REPLACEMENTS = {
    1: {'name': 'WINHTTP', 'replacements': {
        b'WINHTTP.DLL': b'MYHTTP.DLL\x00',
        b'WINHTTP.dll': b'MYHTTP.dll\x00',
    }},
    2: {'name': 'WININET', 'replacements': {
        b'WININET.DLL': b'MYINET.DLL\x00',
        b'WININET.dll': b'MYINET.dll\x00',
    }},
}
```

**Important:** Replacement length must equal original length. Pad with `\x00` if needed.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. IAT Modification (Python/PyQt6)
Directly edits the Import Address Table in the PE file header to redirect DLL imports.

### 2. Hex Patching (Python/PyQt6)
Scans binary content for DLL name sequences and replaces them throughout the file.

### 3. Native API Emulation (C/llvm-mingw)
Replacement DLL emulators provide drop-in replacements for system APIs with custom behavior:
- Compiled with **llvm-mingw 21.1.3 (LLVM 21.1.3)**
- Native x64 Windows binaries
- Transparent API interception
- Full Windows API compatibility

### 4. Multi-threaded Processing (Python)
Operations run asynchronously, keeping the GUI responsive during heavy workloads.

### 5. Safety Features (Python)
- Automatic backups in `backup/` folder
- Windows permission elevation
- Detailed operation logging
- Checksum recalculation

---

## 📊 Supported APIs (Default)

- ✅ WINHTTP
- ✅ WININET
- ✅ WS2_32
- ✅ SENSAPI
- ✅ IPHLPAPI
- ✅ URLMON
- ✅ NETAPI32
- ✅ WSOCK32
- ✅ WINTRUST

*Easily extensible – add custom APIs to `config.py` and compile emulators with llvm-mingw*

---

## 💡 Use Cases

### Replace Standard Libraries with Custom Versions
```python
b'WINHTTP.DLL': b'CUSTOM.DLL\x00'
```

### Network Traffic Interception (C Emulator)
```python
b'WININET.DLL': b'PROXY.DLL\x00\x00\x00'
# Native proxy emulator compiled with llvm-mingw intercepts calls
```

### DirectX Version Swapping
Add to `config.py`:
```python
b'D3D9.DLL': b'D3D9_EX.DLL\x00'
```

## 🔨 Building Native Libraries (Developers)

### Prerequisites
1. Download **llvm-mingw 20251007** from [mstorsjo/llvm-mingw releases](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases)
2. Extract and add to PATH
3. Ensure `clang`, `clang++`, and `x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc` are available

### Build Commands

```bash
# Navigate to source directory
cd src/

# Build individual emulator
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -shared -O3 -o winhttp_replacement.dll winhttp_replacement.c

# Or use provided Makefile
make all

# Place compiled DLLs in api/ directory
mv *.dll ../api/
```

### Makefile Example
```makefile
CC = x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc
CFLAGS = -shared -fPIC -O3 -Wall
TARGET = api/

all: winhttp_replacement.dll wininet_replacement.dll

winhttp_replacement.dll: src/winhttp_replacement.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET)$@ $<

wininet_replacement.dll: src/wininet_replacement.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $(TARGET)$@ $<

clean:
	rm -f $(TARGET)*.dll
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Backup First:** Always create system restore points before patching
- **Test Before Production:** Use virtual machines for initial testing
- **Update Awareness:** Some settings may reset after Windows updates
- **Signature Impact:** Patching may invalidate digital signatures
- **Native Library Compatibility:** Ensure emulator DLLs are compiled for target architecture

---

## 🔄 Restoring Original Files

If patching causes issues:

1. Restore from `backup/` folder
2. Use system restore point (if created)
3. Manually restore from clean installation

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| ModuleNotFoundError | Run `pip install PyQt6 pefile` |
| "No files found" | Ensure PE files exist with correct format |
| Permission denied | Run with admin privileges on Windows |
| UI frozen | Wait for patching to complete (progress bar shows status) |
| Native DLL not found | Verify emulator DLLs in `api/` folder and recompile with llvm-mingw if needed |
| "Entry point not found" | Ensure DLL was compiled with compatible architecture (x64) |
